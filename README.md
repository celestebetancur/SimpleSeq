Run ``./ssqi`` for the interpreted mode, ``./ssq file output``to 'compile' to a CHmUsiCK's file
or ``./ssqc file`` to run ``file`` and then change ``file`` using any text editor , then recompile 
using ``./ssq file`` and you will hear the changes.

If you want to use your own samples, simply copy the folders
in dirt folder.

Folder's name must not contain numbers or spaces, samples must not
be in subfolders and every sample must be named with numbers.

Only ``.wav`` for now.
